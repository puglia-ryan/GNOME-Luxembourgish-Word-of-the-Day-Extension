# GNOME-Luxembourgish-Word-of-the-Day-Extension
An extension for GNOME which fetches the Luxembougish word of the day from lod.lu and displays it along with translations on your desktop wallpaper.
It makes use of LOD.lu 's API.
A similar extension was made by "Adart" (https://github.com/praczet/lu-wotd), but since it was out of date for the newest GNOME version, I decided to make my own version.
The extension checks every hour if the word of the day has been updated yet.
## Example:
<img width="2560" height="1408" alt="Screenshot From 2025-11-02 16-25-19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94355b35-829b-4731-a76d-ee90cd53b905" />

## Installation:
The extension can be installed on the GNOME extensions site or from the GNOME extensions software

## Plans:
- Add customisation options (size, placement, translated language choice)
